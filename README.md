# ListConductor
### By Sebastian Patin

This is an application that allows users to create edit and delete playlists, and add, and delete songs from Spotify API to those playlists.

### ListConductor utilizes:
- Vite
- React (Typescript Template)
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- LocalStorage

### Usage

A Spotify account is required for this application.

To create a new playlist, type a title in the sidebar, then click the plus icon next to it.
To add a new song to a playlist, search the title of the song at the top of the playlist section, then click the desired song. Whichever playlist you are viewing will be the playlist you add the song to, utilizing localStorage to keep track of songs and playlists.

This application was created to test my Typescript/UI skills.
